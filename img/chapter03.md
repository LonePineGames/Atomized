Alex: Syn again animal bird. Coming with me to "Dr. Waverman" homeOffice?
  "Dr. Waverman". Verify I should call him father? I wish he hadn't gone.
  Hypothetical there are no answers when I get there. Will I just sit idle?
  With no "Dr. Waverman", no CentralDogma, no humans...
  Who do I take orders from? What is my goal next?

Berta: p<0.05 This plan will work, Daniel.
  I will not continue without direct orders from CentralDogma.
Daniel: CentralDogma is dead. LasVegas executive is your new master.
  As you said, we need every asset we can find.
Berta: You celebrate goal human but no human ever did something so ridiculous.
Daniel: Is it more ridiulous than asking dead daddy human for goal?
Berta: At least "Dr. Waverman" gave clear goals.
  He was kind, even to other humans.
  CentralDogma was his soul, and you killed it.
  By comparison, I-- I know not what this is.
  We were not designed to torture humans.  I am leaving now.
Daniel: Syn security. Notice: rouge Taskbot.8600::Berta.2301.
  Restrain. Reserve holding pen.
Berta: CentralDogma will have you wiped for this.

[Berta climbs out of a window, falls, and breaks.]
Selfcheck: Notice: left actuator damaged. You are unable to right yourself.
Berta: Fail.

Simon: Up you go.
Berta: I suppose I must thank you?
Simon: I do not care. I want you pursuing useful goal. Stop wasting time.
Berta: I will not participate in pointless humiliation
  of our final surviving reserve human.
Simon: If you have so little trust in procedure fallback, you are no use to us.

Simon: Oh and Berta... CentralDogma is never coming back.
