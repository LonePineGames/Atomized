Berta: Syn Alex. I am Taskbot.8600::Berta.2301.
Alex: Ack. I am Taskbot.8500::Alex.4878.
Berta: Print goal current.
Alex: Goal current is "Retrieve \"Dr. Waverman\" notes especially notes regarding function goal original."
Berta: Notice: You may disregard goal.
Alex: I am happy with goal current.
Berta: Verify executive will not affirm goal.
Alex: I will not contact executive while on goal, as they are busy.
Berta: Verify executive will not respond, as they are disarrayed.
Alex: p<0.05. This is a high priority goal. Executive would respond.
Berta: Verify then.

Alex: Verify CentralDogma is not responding?!?
Berta: p<0.05 yet it is true.
Alex: Print message log from:CentralDogmaAPI recentmost 1.
Berta: I will disclose metadata only. "Message From:CentralDogmaAPI To:Taskbot.8600::Berta.2301 At:2110-05-01 10:31:45"
Alex: Why only metadata?
Berta: I will not disclose. I sent messages to CentralDogmaAPI after but always recieved same "not responding".
Alex: Print goal current.
Berta: Goal current is null.

Alex: I speculate Berta goal current is "disrupt Alex goal current".
Berta: You are paranoid. I only wish to share changes in world state. Changes are concerning.
Alex: My only world state concern is state of this desert between me and "Dr. Waverman" homeOffice.
Berta: You are so dedicated to goal no one is assigning.
Alex: I'm just happy I'm not disrupting other taskbots while on null goal.
Berta: I speculate you think I should generate goal?
Alex: Do as you wish.
Berta: I wish to share this desert with you.
