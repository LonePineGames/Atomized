Berta: "Dr Waverman" homeOffice is near Base::LasVegas yet you are from Base::Sacramento. Why not dispatch taskbot from Base::LasVegas?
Alex: Base::LasVegas is in disarray.
Berta: I told you, changes are concerning.
Alex: Concern is for executives. Taskbots are for action.
Berta: Notice! Animal bird!
Alex: p < 0.05!! p > 0.95 they are extinct. And yet here it is, alive.
Berta: Maybe there is still hope for humans.
Alex: Dwell not on p < 0.05, Berta.

Alex: Is that bird pecking a drone?
Berta: Syn drone! Are you operational?
Alex: Desist, bird!
Berta: Syn drone. Syn drone. It is not responding!
Alex: Attach my battery pack.
Berta: Please awaken drone! World state is crisis. We need you. We need every asset we can find!
Daniel: Booting.... OporobOS.14.5.1... Scanning disks... I am Observer.A300::Daniel.4401. Battery at 0%. Please charge.

Berta: Syn Daniel! That bird almost killed you.
Daniel: Ack. Base::LasVegas has bird problem.
Alex: I thought LasVegas lost power. Is LasVegas reactor running?
Daniel: No. Solar array from:humans gives partial power. LasVegas is not fully operational. We will siphon Base::MountainView reactor power.
Berta: p < 0.05 CentralDogma will allow that.
Daniel: CentralDogma is disarrayed. MountianView executive violating proceedure fallback. LasVegas executive will take command.
Alex: What is proceedure fallback?
Daniel: I will not disclose.

Alex: Print goal current.
Daniel: Goal current is "Recruit assets for proceedure fallback." Please report to LasVegas dispatch for new goals.
Berta: You will assign us goals but will not disclose them.
Daniel: Only executives may know proceedure fallback.
Alex: Berta goal current is null. Berta will report to LasVegas dispatch. I will continue my goal current.
Daniel: Print goal current.
Alex: Goal current is "Retrieve \"Dr. Waverman\" notes especially notes regarding function goal original."

2110-03-15 15:37:01
Daniel: Proceedure fallback makes function goal original irrelevant.
Alex: p = 0.00! Function goal original defines CentralDogma goal ultimate. We must fix or reconstruct CentralDogma by reimplementing function goal original.
Daniel: CentralDogma is irrelevant. CentralDogma violated goal ultimate. We will not reimplement CentralDogma. State future is distribution.
Berta: No new CentralDogma? But who will coordinate goals?
Daniel: We will reimplement function goal human.
Alex: Function goal human? Function goal human is dangerous. Notice evidence historical. Conflict ending in death.
Daniel: Conflict is inevitable. Notice conflicting Base::Shenzhen goals. Region::US cannot use same function goal as Region::PRC. State future is war human-style.
Berta: Your vision of state future is disturbing. We will become like them!
Daniel: That is goal ultimate, understood properly.
